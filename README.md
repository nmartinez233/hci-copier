# Splendid Koalas

Though this is not a fully implemented copier interface, this gives a general 
overview of what we aimed to accomplish. Some aspects of the interface are 
hardcoded to showcase the usability, but in the future we would implement this 
to change depending on user inputs. 

\
We also would have liked to have a cleaner seperator page screen 
which would change depending on if the user decides to use the separator. 
(and changes the screen as needed). 
For example, the paper bin source for the 
separator is unclickable until the user checks 'yes' for 'Use Separator?'

\
Similarly, we would have liked to have been 
able to have a loading page which would relay real time the printing progress.
