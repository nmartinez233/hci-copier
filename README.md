# Splendid Koalas

Though this is not a fully implemented copier interface, this gives a general overview of what we aimed to accomplish. Some aspects of the interface are hardcoded but in the future we would implement this to change depending on user inputs. We also would have liked to have a cleaner seperator page screen which would change depending on if the user selects the seperator page or not (and changes the screen as needed). Similarly, we would have liked to have been able to have a loading page which would relay real time the printing progress.
